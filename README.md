# Used Cars Analysis
 
#OVERVIEW
Our model works on predicting the worthiness of pre-owned cars to help customers know if it's a good buy. With all the necessary data preparation done, we will be using supervised machine learning algorithm specifically regression to predict the prices. In addition to this, we will be warning the buyer on safety terms based on the prior accident chances with location as a primary parameter. Ending to this, we will give the visual deliverable.

##DATA SOURCES
We will be using the following data sets in our project which are sourced from Kaggle
1) [Used Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) which contains vehicle listings from Craigslist.org. This dataset contains all variables Craigslist provides on car sales including drive type, manufacturer, price, condition, location and 20 other columns. Size: 1.35GB (509577 rows)

2) [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) which contains all the information related to vehicle crashes from NYC OpenData. The data tables contain information reported by police on vehicle collisions in NYC with variables including crash date, location, primary vehicle type and severity. Size: 348 MB (1649087 rows)

Joining criterion of above datasets: (Vehicle Type) We will classifying the vehicle types in Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes Dataset to match the vehicle types in Used Cars dataset
